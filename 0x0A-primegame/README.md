# Prime Game

- Algorithm
- Python

## Concepts Needed

- Prime Numbers:

    - Understanding what prime numbers are.
    - Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.

- Sieve of Eratosthenes:

    - An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, which can be particularly useful for this task.

- Game Theory:

    - Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.
    - Understanding win conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.

- Dynamic Programming/Memoization:

    - Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.

- Python Programming:

    - Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.
    - Arrays and lists for storing the integers and tracking removed numbers.


## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All my files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- The first line of all my files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- My code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All my files must be executable
