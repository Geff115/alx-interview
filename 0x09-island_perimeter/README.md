# Island Perimeter

## Algorithm, Python

## Concepts needed

- 2D Arrays (Matrices):

    - Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
    - Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

- Conditional Logic:

    - Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

- Counting Techniques:

    - Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.

- Problem-Solving Strategies:

    - Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

- Python Programming:

    - Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
    - Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
