CONCEPTS NEEDED TO KNOW

    . Dynamic Programming:

        - Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and  building up the solution.
        - Dynamic Programming (GeeksforGeeks)
    
    . Prime Factorization:

        - Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number n.
        - Prime Factorization (Khan Academy)
    
    . Code Optimization:

        - Knowing how to approach problems from an optimization perspective can be useful in finding the most efficient solution.
        - How to optimize Python code
    
    . Greedy Algorithms:

        - The problem can also be approached with greedy algorithms, choosing the best option at each step.
        - Greedy Algorithms (GeeksforGeeks)
    
    . Basic Python Programming:

        - Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary to implement the solution.
